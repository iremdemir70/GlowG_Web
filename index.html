            <h3>Problem definition:</h3>
            <p>Skin care is vital for both physical health and aesthetics, but identifying skin type and selecting appropriate products can be challenging. 
              Misjudging skin type often leads to using incorrect products, causing issues like irritation, dryness, oiliness, or acne. 
              This not only harms skin health but also results in financial losses and reduced confidence in skincare. The wide range of products and lack of knowledge 
              about ingredients further complicates the decision-making process, forcing individuals to rely on advertisements and generic advice.
            </p>
              <h3>Problem solution:</h3>
              <p>
